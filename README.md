# Overview of the `Trader` class

The class only requires a single method called `run`, which is called by the simulation every time a new `TraderState` is available. The logic within this `run` method is written by the player and determines the behaviour of the algorithm. The output of the method is a dictionary named `result`, which contains all the orders that the algorithm decides to send based on this logic.
