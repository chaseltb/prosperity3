# Overview of the `Trader` class

The class only requires a single method called `run`, which is called by the simulation every time a new `TraderState` is available. The logic within this `run` method is written by the player and determines the behaviour of the algorithm. The output of the method is a dictionary named `result`, which contains all the orders that the algorithm decides to send based on this logic.


# Example of Trading

For the following example we assume a situation with two products:

- PRODUCT1 with position limit 10
- PRODUCT2 with position limit 20

At the start of the first iteration the run method is called with the `TradingState` generated by the below code. Note: the [datamodel.py](http://datamodel.py) file from which the classes are imported is provided in Appendix B. The code can also be used to test algorithms locally.

from datamodel import Listing, OrderDepth, Trade, TradingState

timestamp = 1000

listings = {
	"PRODUCT1": Listing(
		symbol="PRODUCT1", 
		product="PRODUCT1", 
		denomination= "SEASHELLS"
	),
	"PRODUCT2": Listing(
		symbol="PRODUCT2", 
		product="PRODUCT2", 
		denomination= "SEASHELLS"
	),
}

order_depths = {
	"PRODUCT1": OrderDepth(
		buy_orders={10: 7, 9: 5},
		sell_orders={11: -4, 12: -8}
	),
	"PRODUCT2": OrderDepth(
		buy_orders={142: 3, 141: 5},
		sell_orders={144: -5, 145: -8}
	),	
}

own_trades = {
	"PRODUCT1": [],
	"PRODUCT2": []
}

market_trades = {
	"PRODUCT1": [
		Trade(
			symbol="PRODUCT1",
			price=11,
			quantity=4,
			buyer="",
			seller="",
			timestamp=900
		)
	],
	"PRODUCT2": []
}

position = {
	"PRODUCT1": 3,
	"PRODUCT2": -5
}

observations = {}
traderData = ""

state = TradingState(
	traderData,
	timestamp,
  listings,
	order_depths,
	own_trades,
	market_trades,
	position,
	observations
)
