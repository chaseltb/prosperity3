# Overview of the `Trader` class

The class only requires a single method called `run`, which is called by the simulation every time a new `TraderState` is available. The logic within this `run` method is written by the player and determines the behaviour of the algorithm. The output of the method is a dictionary named `result`, which contains all the orders that the algorithm decides to send based on this logic.


# Example of Trading

For the following example we assume a situation with two products:

- PRODUCT1 with position limit 10
- PRODUCT2 with position limit 20

At the start of the first iteration the run method is called with the `TradingState` generated by the below code. Note: the [datamodel.py](http://datamodel.py) file from which the classes are imported is provided in Appendix B. The code can also be used to test algorithms locally.
